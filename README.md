## Unpacking the S&P 500

I am exploring the S&P 500. How has it changed over time? How much variation is there across sectors and companies? Do prices in the previous day(s) predict future prices?

I started exploring in R using Kaggle data. I then discovered the `[yfinance]}`(https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/) library in Python. I will start using that data, which covers more years.
